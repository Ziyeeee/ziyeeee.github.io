    Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on 
    current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning.
    Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial 
    predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored.

    To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in 
    weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic 
    radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting.
    Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 
    3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements 
    across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly 
    effective for prediction tasks.

    With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates 
    a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian 
    groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency 
    and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals.

    The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over 
    $16 \times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba 
    outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.
