    Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
  </p>
  <p>
    His research interests forcus on <strong>Embodied Intelligence</strong> and <strong>3D Computer Vision</strong>. Previously, he worked on 
    AI for Geoscience. 

    He has published first-author papers in <strong>ICLR</strong> and <strong>IEEE TGRS</strong> and serves as a reviewer for <strong>ACM TOMM</strong>.

    His proposed STC-GS representation and framework effectively address the reconstruction and prediction of 3D spatiotemporal sequences. 
    This work has been accepted as an <strong>ICLR 2025 Oral</strong>. It's a promising approach for advancing <strong>Embodied Intelligence</strong> 
    and <strong>3D Scene Understanding</strong>. He is currently extending this work to <strong>Embodied Manipulation Tasks</strong> and 
    <strong>3D World Models</strong>.
